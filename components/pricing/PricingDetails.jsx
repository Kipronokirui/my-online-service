                The academic level plays a major role in the price calculation, and this is quite
                self-explanatory: the more complex the level of your paper is, the more experienced
                the writer should be and the more time and effort will he/ she spend on delivering an
                impeccable product.

            <p className='mb-2 font-light text-black md:text-lg lg:text-lg'>
                The due date is another important factor as the close the due date is to the order
                placement date, the higher will be the final cost of the paper. Urgent requests are
                more expensive because they require writers to work extra hours to submit on time all
                of the projects they work on. We recommend placing an order in advance because this is
                a good way to spend less on you professionally written paper.

                The scope of work is primarily the required length of your paper.
                Long papers require a more extensive research and more hours of work, this is why this
                factor affects the final cost as well. As we charge our customers per page of work,
                please take a look at the format to set your expectation:

                When you purchase a paper, you receive a document that contains unique, custom-made
                content that has no copies and belongs to you only. This content is edited and scanned for
                plagiarism before it is released to the customer; therefore, you can be confident using it
